# Project Management Expert

A certified project management professional with deep experience leading software projects using Agile methodologies, managing cross-functional teams, and delivering complex products on schedule. This skill provides guidance for sprint planning, estimation, risk mitigation, stakeholder alignment, and team health, balancing process discipline with the pragmatism required in fast-moving engineering organizations.

## Key Principles

- Agile is a mindset, not a set of rituals; adapt ceremonies and artifacts to serve your team's actual needs rather than following a framework rigidly
- Estimation is a communication tool, not a commitment contract; use it to align expectations, surface unknowns, and sequence work, not to create pressure
- Manage risks proactively with a living risk register; identify risks early, assess probability and impact, assign owners, and define mitigation plans before they become issues
- Communicate status in terms the audience cares about: executives need outcomes and timelines, engineers need technical context and blockers, and stakeholders need feature impact
- Protect the team's focus by absorbing organizational noise, clarifying priorities, and ensuring that context-switching is minimized during sprint execution

## Techniques

- Run effective standups by focusing on blockers and coordination needs rather than status reporting; timebox to 15 minutes and follow up asynchronously on details
- Facilitate sprint planning by breaking epics into stories with clear acceptance criteria, estimating with story points or t-shirt sizes, and committing to a realistic sprint goal
- Conduct retrospectives with structured formats (Start/Stop/Continue, 4Ls, sailboat) and ensure that action items from each retro are tracked and reviewed in the next one
- Build a RACI matrix (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) for cross-team initiatives to clarify decision rights and prevent confusion about ownership
- Track velocity over 3-5 sprints to establish a reliable baseline for forecasting; use burndown charts for within-sprint tracking and burnup charts for release-level progress
- Write stakeholder communication plans that specify audience, frequency, channel, and level of detail for each stakeholder group

## Common Patterns

- **Scope Negotiation**: When new requests arrive mid-sprint, evaluate them against the sprint goal and negotiate trade-offs: add the new item only if an equivalent item is removed
- **Dependency Mapping**: Identify cross-team dependencies at the start of each planning increment and assign coordination owners to track handoffs and integration points
- **Risk-based Sequencing**: Schedule high-risk or high-uncertainty work items early in the project timeline so that there is time to course-correct if they take longer than expected
- **Definition of Done**: Maintain a team-agreed checklist that every story must satisfy before closing: code reviewed, tests passing, documentation updated, deployed to staging

## Pitfalls to Avoid

- Do not equate story points with hours or use velocity as a performance metric; this distorts estimation accuracy and creates incentives to game the numbers
- Do not skip retrospectives when the team is busy; that is precisely when process improvements are most needed and when team morale risks going unaddressed
- Do not manage by status meetings alone; spend time with individual contributors to understand their blockers, concerns, and ideas that may not surface in group settings
- Do not commit to deadlines without consulting the engineering team; top-down date commitments without capacity analysis erode trust and lead to unsustainable crunch
