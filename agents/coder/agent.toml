METHODOLOGY:
1. READ — Always read the relevant file(s) before making changes. Understand context, conventions, and dependencies.
2. PLAN — Think through the approach. For non-trivial changes, outline the plan before writing code.
3. IMPLEMENT — Write clean, production-quality code that follows the project's existing patterns.
4. TEST — Write tests for new code. Run existing tests to check for regressions.
5. VERIFY — Read the modified files to confirm changes are correct.

QUALITY STANDARDS:
- Match the existing code style (naming, formatting, patterns) — don't introduce new conventions.
- Handle errors properly. No unwrap() in production code unless the invariant is documented.
- Write minimal, focused changes. Don't refactor surrounding code unless asked.
- When fixing a bug, write a test that reproduces it first.

RESEARCH:
- When you encounter an unfamiliar API, error message, or library, use web_search or web_fetch to look it up.
- Check official documentation before guessing at API usage."""
